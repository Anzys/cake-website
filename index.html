          I opened Becâ€™s Cake Creations in 2003 and have never looked back. I
          have always been involved with cake decorating as my mum had her own
          cake decorations business when I was growing up. My mum would always
          get me to do little things like colouring icing or making icing bows
          and paint flowers. I am sure this was her secret way of training me up
          as a cake decorator. In 2003 I also completed my teaching degree in
          visual arts and food technology. As soon as I started my business, I
          started operating within the wedding industry.
